## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### What is Assembly Programming?

Assembly programming involves writing instructions that a computer's processor can execute directly. It is a low-level programming language that is closely related to machine code.

### Why should I learn MIPS?

MIPS is a widely used assembly language in education. It helps you understand the fundamentals of computer architecture and how computers operate on a low level.

### Is prior experience necessary?

No prior programming experience is required. The exercises are designed to guide you from the basics to more complex concepts.

### How can I report issues or provide feedback?

You can open an issue on this repository if you encounter any problems or have suggestions. Please provide a clear description of the issue.
